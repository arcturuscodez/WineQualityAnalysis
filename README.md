# WineQualityAnalysis
Practicing data science using red/white wine datasets.

The data used in this project is from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality none of it is mine. Big thanks to those who recorded the data. 

This project includes a .ipynb file where I have conducted the data science (python, jupyter, pandas, numpy) aspect of the project and included is a powerpoint presentation where I conducted an analysis on my findings.
